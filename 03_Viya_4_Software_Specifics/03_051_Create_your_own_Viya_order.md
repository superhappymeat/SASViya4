**_Note : In this hands-on we create our own Viya 4 order. We use the internal application "makeorder.sas.com". If you are following this VLE as a partner, you skip this section. It is not a pre-requisite for the following hands-on._**

# Create your own order

* [Use "Makeorder" and select your products](#use-makeorder-and-select-your-products)
* [Review the order in COMSAT](#review-the-order-in-comsat)
* [Download your Order's deployment assets](#download-your-orders-deployment-assets)
* [Conclusion](#conclusion)
* [Navigation](#navigation)

## Use "Makeorder" and select your products

* Open the [makeorder.sas.com](https://makeorder.sas.com/makeorder) internal web application.
* Fullfill the header : the platform must be "Linux for x86_64 (LAX) (LINA)" as today it is the only supported platform for Viya 4.

    ![header](img/2020-07-17-09-56-38.png)

* Then you can select some products, for example SAS Studio Analyst and the "Visual Machine Learning" offering.

    ![products](img/order-products.png)

* You might have noticed that we don't see anymore the long list of SAS/ACCESS products in the Order products list. It is because they are now included in the offerings.
* Click on Submit and after a little while, you should see a dialog as below

    ![order created](img/order-completed.png)

    _Note : the orders starts with "09", it means it is an internal order that can be directly deployed ONLY inside of the SAS internal network_

* Click on the link to review the order in COMSAT (which is another SAS internal web application)

## Review the order in COMSAT

* The link will open the COMSAT application and show you your own order.

    ![order in comsat](img/order-in-comsat.png)

* From here you can check the products ordered by the customer, the number of downloads, the Processing history, etc...
* Click on the "Customer portal" tab (this tab is only available for Viya 4 orders)

    ![customer](img/customer-portal.png)

    In this tab we can create another customer account to access the order in the portal. We can also view the access history.

    _Note: COMSAT allows you to see any type of SAS order (SAS 9, Viya 3.x, Viya 4, interal and external)_

## Download your Order's deployment assets

After creating your order, you will shortly receive an email similar to the one below.

![emailorder](img/email-order.png)

If you click on the link "Get Started", it will open up the SAS Portal page.

![Signin](img/sign-in.png)

You will have to sign-in with your sas.com account (or create it if you don't have one).

Once logged in, you should be able to see your order.

![myorder](img/myorder.png)

_IMPORTANT: If you don't see your order in the SAS Portal, try to do it from in "incognito" mode or retry after a clean up of your web browser history/cookies._

Click on the little icon and you will see the order details.

![order details](img/myorder-details.png)

Now, you can pick a version and click on "Download Deployment Assets" to download an archive of the files that you will need for the Viya 4 Deployment.

## Conclusion

We will NOT perform the Viya deployment with the sample internal order that you might have created during this specific hands-on.
Because the remaining of the VLE Hands-on steps happens in the RACE.EXNET environment which does not have access to the SAS Internal network.
However, we have seen what it takes to create a Viya 4 order, the kind of information that we can find about a specific order in COMSAT and also how you can get the deployment assets to follow up with the installation steps.
