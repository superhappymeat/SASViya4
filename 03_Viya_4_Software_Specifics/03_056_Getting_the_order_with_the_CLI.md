_Note : In this hands-on we use our own Viya 4 order created with the internal application "makeorder.sas.com". If you are following this VLE as a partner, you skip this section. It is not a pre-requisite for the following hands-on._

## Intro

* The process for obtaining licenses, certificates or deployment assets for an order can be automated, thanks to a handy new command-line tool.
* The [viya4-orders-cli](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-orders-cli) has been developed to programmatically retrieve these files, by running it directly from the command-line or in a Docker image.
* Itâ€™s available on GitHub and anyone can download it.

## Requirements

* You need to have a SAS Profile (sas.com account)
* You need to have access to at least one order with your sas.com account.

## Getting the Order CLI

* If we want to use Go or docker we have to clone the viya4-orders-cli tool from GitHub

    ```sh
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-orders-cli.git

    # but choose a static version!
    cd ~/viya4-orders-cli
    git checkout 1.0.0

    ```

Then choose **one** of the following method : Go, docker or pre-built binary.

### Method 1: Building the Go Version of the Order CLI

* Build the go executable

    ```sh
    #first let's install go
    sudo yum install go -y
    go version

    cd ~/viya4-orders-cli
    go build main.go

    ```

### Method 2: Building the docker image of the Order CLI

* A very simple step, to build your own docker image of the Order CLI:

    ```sh
    cd ~/viya4-orders-cli
    docker build . -t viya4-orders-cli
    ```

* Note that this step might fail with an error like :

    ```log
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  12.18MB
    Step 1/16 : FROM golang:1.13 AS builder
    toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit
    ```

You did not make any mistake. It is just because since November 2020 Docker Hub restricts the number of anonymous and free autenthicated downloads.

When we build our order CLI Docker image, we build it from the public golang Docker image that we try to get from the Docker Hub.

If you face this issue, you can either try later or move on to one of the two alternative method ("Go" or "pre-built binary").

### Method 3: Use the pre-built binary file

* do the following to download the pre-built binary of the Order CLI:

    ```sh
    VERSION_ORDER_CLI=1.0.0
    URL_ORDER_CLI=https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-orders-cli/releases/download/${VERSION_ORDER_CLI}/viya4-orders-cli_linux_amd64

    ansible localhost \
        -b --become-user=root \
        -m get_url \
        -a  "url=${URL_ORDER_CLI} \
            dest=/usr/local/bin/viya4-orders-cli \
            validate_certs=no \
            force=yes \
            owner=root \
            mode=0755 \
            backup=yes" \
        --diff
    ```

## Getting your own API keys from the portal

* Open the [SAS API Portal](https://apiportal.sas.com/)

    ![API portal](img/2020-09-29-10-58-59.png)

* Sign in with your SAS.com account and click on "Apps" in the ribbon.

    ![API portal signed in](img/2020-09-29-11-00-11.png)

* Click on "New App"

    ![new App](img/2020-09-29-11-05-31.png)

* Provide a name and description, click on "enable", then click on "Create"

    ![new app](img/new-app-description.png)

* An API token is created for you (Application ID and secret) an will allow you to access the Order API.

    ![key and secret](img/api-key-and-secret.png)

* Click on "Save"
* We will now copy the **API Key** and **secret** from the SAS Portal and "bas64" encode them (you can use the "Copy" button in the portal).
* Copy the code below in your favorite text editor, replace with your own API key and secret, then copy paste the code in your terminal ans run it.

    ```sh
    echo -n <your API key> | base64 > /tmp/clientid.txt
    echo -n <your secret> | base64 > /tmp/secret.txt
    echo "clientCredentialsId= "\"$(cat /tmp/clientid.txt)\" > $HOME/.viya4-orders-cli.env
    echo "clientCredentialsSecret= "\"$(cat /tmp/secret.txt)\" >> $HOME/.viya4-orders-cli.env
    ```

## Getting the Deployment Assets

* Set the order number. You will use the order number corresponding to the order that you have created in the previous [hands-on](03_051_Create_your_own_Viya_order.md).

    ```sh
    #ORDER_NUMBER=9CDZDD
    ORDER_NUMBER=<YOUR OWN ORDER NUMBER>
    ```

Depending on your choice in the previous section for the Order CLI method (go, docker, or pre-built binary), choose one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using the go version

* Now you can use the order CLI tool to get the Deployment Assets. You have to provide your own order number ans a specific cadence release.

    ```sh
    CADENCE_NAME='stable'
    CADENCE_VERSION='2020.1.5'
    go run main.go -c $HOME/.viya4-orders-cli.env dep ${ORDER_NUMBER} ${CADENCE_NAME} ${CADENCE_VERSION}
    ```

* You should see something like:

    ```yaml
    2021/02/22 10:58:14 INFO: using config file: /home/cloud-user/.viya4-orders-cli.env
    OrderNumber: 9CDZDD
    AssetName: deploymentAssets
    AssetReqURL: https://api.sas.com/mysas/orders/9CDZDD/cadenceNames/stable/cadenceVersions/2020.1.3/deploymentAssets
    AssetLocation: /home/cloud-user/viya4-orders-cli/SASViyaV4_9CDZDD_stable_2020.1.3_20210219.1613697732393_deploymentAssets_2021-02-19T070151.tgz
    Cadence: Stable 2020.1.5
    CadenceRelease: 20210219.1613697732393
    ```

* Just type ```ls -alrt | grep SASViya``` to make sure there is now a Deployment Assets archive file in the current folder.

    ```log
    -rw-rw-r--   1 cloud-user cloud-user   364187 Feb 22 10:58 SASViyaV4_9CDZDD_stable_2020.1.3_20210219.1613697732393_deploymentAssets_2021-02-19T070151.tgz
    ```

### Method 2: Using docker

* Run the docker command to get the deployment assets in /tmp

    ```sh
    # copy the credential in a folder to be mounted in docker
    cp $HOME/.viya4-orders-cli.env /tmp
    # create an output subfolder in a folder to be mounted in docker
    mkdir /tmp/sasfiles

    CADENCE_NAME='stable'
    CADENCE_VERSION='2020.1.5'

    # download the deployment assets
    docker run -v /tmp:/sasstuff viya4-orders-cli deploymentAssets ${ORDER_NUMBER} ${CADENCE_NAME} ${CADENCE_VERSION} \
    --config /sasstuff/.viya4-orders-cli.env --file-path /sasstuff/sasfiles --file-name ${ORDER_NUMBER}_stable_depassets
    ```

* You should see

    ```log
    OrderNumber: 9CDZDD
    AssetName: deploymentAssets
    AssetReqURL: https://api.sas.com/mysas/orders/9CDZDD/cadenceNames/stable/cadenceVersions/2020.1.3/deploymentAssets
    AssetLocation: /sasstuff/sasfiles/9CDZDD_stable_depassets.tgz
    Cadence: Stable 2020.1.5
    CadenceRelease: 20210219.1613697732393
    [cloud-user@rext03-0289 viya4-orders-cli]$ ls /tmp/sasfiles/
    9CDZDD_stable_depassets.tgz
    ```

### Method 3: Using the pre-built binary

* Use the binary

    ```sh
    cd
    viya4-orders-cli --config $HOME/.viya4-orders-cli.env dep ${ORDER_NUMBER} ${CADENCE_NAME} ${CADENCE_VERSION}
    ```

* You should see

    ```log
    2021/02/22 11:07:06 INFO: using config file: /home/cloud-user/.viya4-orders-cli.env
    OrderNumber: 9CDZDD
    AssetName: deploymentAssets
    AssetReqURL: https://api.sas.com/mysas/orders/9CDZDD/cadenceNames/stable/cadenceVersions/2020.1.3/deploymentAssets
    Cadence: Stable 2020.1.5
    CadenceRelease: 20210219.1613697732393
    ```

### Clean up

* Now let's delete the Deployment Assets as we can not use internal orders in the deployment.

    ```sh
    # delete dep assets generated with go
    rm -Rf /home/cloud-user/viya4-orders-cli/SASViyaV4_${ORDER_NUMBER}*
    # delete dep assets generated with docker
    rm -Rf /tmp/sasfiles
    # delete dep assets generated with prebuilt binary
    rm -Rf  $HOME/SASViyaV4_${ORDER_NUMBER}*
    ```

* For the next hands-on you will use the deployment assets that we have already downloaded for you.
